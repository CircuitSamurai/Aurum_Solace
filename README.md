Aurum Solace

Aurum Solace is a local-first, adaptive AI system designed to help regulate mood, focus, and discipline through behavioral signals, environmental feedback, and autonomous actuation. 
The project combines backend intelligence, learning loops, and planned physical devices—including a mobile robot companion and adaptive LED lighting—to create a system that responds to a person’s mental state in real time. The long-term goal is a private, continuously learning assistant that supports stability and forward momentum through subtle, consistent interventions rather than notifications or reminders.
Aurum Solace is built to run locally, respect privacy, and scale from software-only environments to real-world hardware deployments. 🧠💡🤖




Why I Built This

I built Aurum Solace because motivation is unreliable, and discipline without feedback eventually breaks.
Most systems tell you what you should do, but they disappear when your energy drops, your focus slips, or your mood turns against you. They don’t stay present when consistency matters most.
This project is about building something that doesn’t flinch when you’re tired, distracted, or low. A system that quietly observes patterns, adapts to reality, and pushes back with the smallest effective action when things start to slide. No hype. No noise. Just consistent pressure in the right direction.
Aurum Solace is designed to operate locally, privately, and continuously—learning from behavior, responding through environment and interaction, and reinforcing progress over time. It’s not about comfort. It’s about stability, awareness, and forward movement, even on the days when willpower is gone.


What It Does (Current)

Tracks mood, energy, and focus through manual and inferred inputs
Infers mental state from free-form text,
Generates coaching suggestions based on recent state and behavior,
Computes action streaks to reinforce consistency

Produces actuation commands for:
Smart lighting,
Audio/soundscapes,
A future robot companion,
Learns from user feedback to adjust behavior over time,
Runs fully offline using a local SQLite database


Planned Hardware Integration

🤖 Robot Companion (Planned) -
Autonomous navigation and obstacle avoidance,
Screen-based face (tablet or embedded display),
Facial expression and speech tone analysis,
Context-aware verbal and behavioral responses,
Designed to reinforce discipline through presence, not nagging

💡 Adaptive LED Lighting (Planned)
Full-room LED strip lighting instead of lamps,
Mood-aware color temperature and brightness,
Environmental regulation tied to mental state,
Camera-assisted emotion detection (optional, local-only)


Disclaimer
Aurum Solace is an experimental personal project and not a medical or mental health device. It is not intended to diagnose, treat, or replace professional care.
All inference and feedback mechanisms are exploratory and designed for research, learning, and personal experimentation only.


Status

This project is actively evolving. Current focus areas include:
Refining actuation logic,
Expanding learning from feedback,
Preparing interfaces for physical devices,
Transitioning inference from rules to local models
